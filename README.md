# python_fitness

This is a sister app to my Django fitness project. It is intended to be a pure Python implementation of the fitness app I'm creating with Django. 
There are a few reasons as to why I'm doing this: first and foremost, it will be a great way to hash out my implementation free of worrying about the web app framework. 
Secondly, I wanted to do a pure Python implementation to see what I could create without the use of a frontend to extend its functionality.
